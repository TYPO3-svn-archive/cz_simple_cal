	<title>Testing</title>
		<para>This section will explain how to set up a testing environment for the extension.</para>
		
		<section xml:id="development.testing.unit">
			<title>Setting up Unit Tests</title>
			<para>
				You need to install the extension <productname>phpunit</productname> in order to run Unit Tests. You can 
				find the extension <link xlink:href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/phpunit/current/"><productname>phpunit</productname> on TER</link>. 
			</para>
			<para>
				There is not much to say on the installation of the extension. It is straight forward and as it comes bundled with
				a PHPUnit library, so you won't even need to install a PEAR package. If you should encounter any difficulties, consult
				the <link xlink:href="http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/extension-manuals/phpunit/3.4.12/view/">documentation on the internet</link> or your local machine. 
			</para>
			<para>
				After successful installation you should see the PHPUnit module in the Admin Section. Click it and select 
				<productname>cz_simple_cal</productname> as extension to run the unit tests. 
				Click <computeroutput>Run all tests</computeroutput> and all the tests should be run. If the bar is not green
				after running all tests or the word "Success" is not displayed at the bottom of the list, something went wrong.  
			</para>

		<section xml:id="development.testing.selenium">
			<title>Setting up Selenium Tests</title>
			<tip>
				<para>
					You should use a seperate TYPO3 installation and database for running selenium tests as you need to create some pages
					for testing.
				</para>
			</tip>
			<para>
				You should have the extension <productname>phpunit</productname> installed as described in the last section.
				All Selenium Tests are run inside PHPUnit, so this is vital.
			</para>
			<note>
				<para>
					If the selenium extension is not enabled, all Selenium Tests will be skipped automatically.
				</para>
			</note>
			<para>
				Now install <productname>Selenium Remote Control (RC)</productname> - if you don't have it running already.<sbr/>
				Download it at <link xlink:href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">selenium.org</link> and unpack. All you need is 
				the <filename class="directory">selenium-remote-control-1.x.x/selenium-server-1.x.x</filename> folder - you might as well delete
				all the others.<sbr/>
				Run the <filename>selenium-server.jar</filename> using <productname>JAVA</productname>, for example by typing
				<userinput>java -jar selenium-server.jar</userinput> on your console.
			</para>
			<para>
				Import the data stored in <filename>Tests/Selenium/typo3_testing.sql</filename> to your database.
			</para>
			<para>
				Use the <productname>scheduler</productname> to create a <literal>Index all events (cz_simple_cal)</literal>-task and run it to
				create all the recurring events.
			</para>
			<note>
				<para>The extension <productname>scheduler</productname> is shipped with the <productname>TYPO3</productname> core but disabled by default.</para>
			</note>
			<para>
				If you have done that install the extension <link xlink:href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/selenium/current/"><productname>selenium</productname> from TER</link>.
				You can ignore the backend module created by that extension and jump back to the PHPUnit module.<sbr/>
				Now if you run the tests again a browser window should pop up and magically call some pages of the frontend.
